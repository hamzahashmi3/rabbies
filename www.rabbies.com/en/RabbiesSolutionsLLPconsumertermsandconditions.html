    <h2>Rabbie&#39;s Terms and Conditions</h2>

<p><strong>Your booking is made subject to the following terms and conditions: </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These terms and conditions, together with any other written information brought to your attention before we confirm your booking, shall form the basis of your contract with Rabbie&#39;s Solutions LLP (a limited liability partnership incorporated in Scotland, No: SO304470) or, in respect of tours undertaken in Ireland, Rabbie&rsquo;s (Ireland) Limited (a company incorporated in Ireland, No.634982) (in either case being &#39;us&#39;, &#39;we&#39; or &ldquo;Rabbie&rsquo;s&rdquo;) in respect of the relevant tour or other holiday experience (together referred to in these terms and conditions as &lsquo;tours&rsquo;) to be provided by Rabbie&rsquo;s. Please read these terms and conditions carefully and contact us if you have any queries.</p>

<p>Within these conditions, &#39;you&#39; and &#39;your&#39; means all persons named on the booking. By making a booking, the &#39;lead passenger&#39; specified in the booking will be deemed to have accepted these conditions on behalf of all passengers named within the booking. For the avoidance of doubt, &lsquo;written&rsquo; or &lsquo;in writing&rsquo; shall, where used in these terms and conditions, include email.</p>

<p>We endeavour to ensure that the information and prices in our brochures and on our website are accurate; however occasionally changes and errors occur and we reserve the right to correct prices and other details in such circumstances. You should check the current price and all other details relating to the arrangements that you wish to book before your booking request is made. All tours are sold subject to availability.</p>

<p>None of these terms and conditions are intended to contravene or contradict the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 (the &ldquo;2018 Regulations&rdquo;) (so far as applicable to your booking) or the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and your statutory rights under any such legislation are not affected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Booking Process</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bookings can be made via our website at <a href="../index.html">www.rabbies.com</a>, by telephone, in person at our booking office or by contacting us by <a href="info/about-us/contact-us.html">email.</a></p>

<p>Your booking is not confirmed until we have issued your booking confirmation. At that point a binding contract will be entered into between us. For any scheduled tours (being single day tours, or tours of more than one day, with a specific itinerary, which are available for booking on scheduled dates from scheduled departure points), full payment will be required at the time of booking and (unless otherwise agreed), a booking confirmation will only be issued once we have received full payment from you. We cannot be held responsible if any tour in which you are interested becomes fully booked or otherwise unavailable prior to full payment being received from you.</p>

<p>Although these terms and conditions refer to various types of tours, it should be noted that Rabbie&rsquo;s may not always offer all of the tours mentioned in these terms.Certain tours may from time to time be sold through our associated business, Rabbie&rsquo;s Trail Burners Limited (No. SC164516) (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;).We reserve the right to direct any enquiry made in respect of such tours to the Company, which will then be subject to the Company&rsquo;s separate terms and conditions of booking, which can be accessed <a href="terms-conditions.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Accommodation and Other Services</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Admission fees or guided tours are not included in the tour price unless expressly stated in the tour description, like in the case of Europe tours.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise expressly stated in the tour description, the cost of accommodation is not included in the price, although we can arrange accommodation on your behalf. If you wish us to do so, we will endeavour to book accommodation falling within the price bracket specified by you. If accommodation within the specified price bracket is not available or cannot be booked for any reason, we will discuss this with you before booking any alternative accommodation on your behalf. The costs of any special requests or supplements (including single supplements and/or child prices) will vary depending on, for example, the policies of the relevant accommodation providers or other suppliers. Please ask us about this at the time of making your booking enquiry. Bookings are made subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant accommodation (or other service) provider. By booking accommodation or other services through us, you enter into a direct contractual relationship with the relevant third party provider and we act solely as an intermediary, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant accommodation (or other service). Unless otherwise advised, payment for accommodation or other services booked on your behalf should be made directly by you to the relevant third party provider.</p>

<p><br />
In addition to the cancellation charges outlined in these terms, cancellation of accommodation or other services booked by us on your behalf may also result in you being liable for cancellation charges levied by the relevant third party provider. Typically the charge made will be the cost of one night&rsquo;s accommodation for each separate accommodation booked (unless the effective cancellation date is within 72 hours of the departure date for the relevant tour, in which event you may be liable for all accommodation costs). Any such costs or charges should be payable to us, so that we may remit them to the relevant provider on your behalf. Please contact <a href="mailto:explore@rabbies.com">explore@rabbies.com </a> if you would like details of supplier cancellation charges relevant to your booking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Tailor Made Tours</h3>

<p>Rabbie&rsquo;s can also create Tailor Made Tours, which are tailored to your/your party&rsquo;s requirements.These may include various elements such as transport, accommodation, meals, car/bus hire, entrance to attractions, guided tours and/or other value added services (together &ldquo;Tailor Made Tours&rdquo;).</p>

<p>If you wish to make a Tailor Made Tour (which includes the booking of a scheduled tour for 10 or more individuals) then please contact us to discuss your requirements further. If we quote a price for a Tailor Made Tour which is based upon a specified number of individuals then, in the event of the size of the group increasing or decreasing in size, we may alter our quoted price accordingly to reflect the revised numbers.</p>

<p>Any changes made following the issue of your booking confirmation may be subject to an administration fee, which is at the discretion of Rabbie&rsquo;s.The fee is typically 10% of the total cost of the tour, up to a maximum of &pound;200, and may be subject to any costs or charges incurred or imposed by any of our suppliers.</p>

<p>Where a booking is made more than 3 months prior to the date of the tour, a 20% deposit will be required to secure the booking.Where a tour is to take place within 3 months, full payment will be required at the time of booking.</p>

<p>To the extent that Tailor Made Tours or other tours provided by us constitute a &lsquo;package&rsquo; for the purposes of the 2018 Regulations, payments made by you will be protected by our membership of ABTOT (see the section below entitled &lsquo;Your Protection&rsquo; for further information).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Changes by Us</h3>

<p><br />
While Rabbie&rsquo;s shall do everything reasonably possible to provide your tour itinerary and/or services as planned, Rabbie&rsquo;s reserves the right to alter itineraries, transport or accommodation if required to do so. In the case of accommodation, a similar standard of accommodation will be obtained wherever possible. The majority of any such alterations will be minor and we will try to advise you of them at the earliest possible date.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event, however, that we are required to significantly alter a material part of your tour or cannot fulfil any special requirements which we have agreed with you, we will notify you of this (and of any impact upon the price of your tour) as quickly as possible in order to enable you to decide how you wish to proceed. In such event, we will ask you to confirm (within such reasonable period as we shall specify) whether you wish:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>to take an alternative tour of equivalent or superior quality, if we are able to offer that, or</li>
	<li>to take a substitute tour of lower quality if we are able to offer that (in which event the difference in price between the original and the substitute tour will be refunded to you); or</li>
	<li>to cancel your booking and obtain a full refund of all monies paid by you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please be aware that the nature of travel involves risks and unpredictable weather and road conditions and we cannot, therefore, guarantee any departure or arrival times at any particular points of a tour itinerary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Changes by You</h3>

<p>If you wish to change any part of your confirmed booking, you should inform us in writing as soon as possible. This should be done by the lead passenger named on the booking. Whilst we will do our best to assist you, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet your request.</p>

<p>Where we can meet a change request made by you, any changes made may be subject to an administration fee (as advised by Rabbie&rsquo;s &ndash; see above regarding Tailor Made Tours). In addition, you may also be required to meet any extra costs incurred by us (and any costs or charges incurred or imposed by any of our suppliers) in making the requested change. Where we are unable to meet your change request and you no longer wish to travel on the basis of the original booking, this will be treated as a cancellation of your booking and cancellation charges may be payable by you, as outlined in these terms.</p>

<p>If, once your booking is confirmed, you are unable to travel for any reason then we will (in accordance with your rights under Regulation 9 of the 2018 Regulations, so far as applicable) allow you to transfer your booking to someone else (introduced by you, and who satisfies all of the conditions applicable to the booking) provided that:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>we are notified of this in writing at least 7 days prior to departure;</li>
	<li>an administration fee per person transferring (as advised by Rabbie&rsquo;s) is paid;</li>
	<li>you and/or the transferee make payment of any costs and charges incurred by us and/or imposed by our accommodation providers or other suppliers, and</li>
	<li>the transferee agrees to these conditions and all other terms of the contract between us.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, no transfer requests or changes will be finally confirmed until full payment of all applicable charges referred to above have been received by Rabbie&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cancellation by Us</h3>

<p><br />
We will only cancel tours due to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances which are outwith our control or which might jeopardise your safety. If we cancel your tour then we will notify you as soon as possible and we will always refund you, in full, for all sums paid by you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cancellation by You</h3>

<p><br />
If you wish to cancel your booking after our booking confirmation has been issued, you should inform us in writing as soon as possible - the effective date of cancellation will be the date upon which we receive such written notification. In the event of cancellation by you, cancellation charges may be payable, as set out below. Any sums due to be refunded to you will (following deduction of any cancellation charges) be refunded within a maximum of 14 days following the effective date of cancellation. These provisions do not restrict any additional rights of cancellation which you may have in terms of the 2018 Regulations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Tailor Made Tours:</h3>

<p>Standard cancellation terms for Tailor Made Tours are as follows*:</p>

<p>a) cancellation more than 13 weeks / 91 days before the tour date: 0% of the price;</p>

<p>b) cancellation between 90 and 65 days before the tour date: 20% of the price</p>

<p>c) cancellation between 64 and 35 days before the tour date: 70% of the price</p>

<p>d) cancellation less than 35 days before the tour date: 100% of the price;</p>

<p>e) in the event of a &lsquo;no show&rsquo; you will be charged 100% of the price.</p>

<p>*Please note however, that the standard cancellation terms above may differ depending on the cancellation terms of any third party supplier providing any element of your Tailor Made Tour.The standard terms above are therefore subject to any variations advised at the time of quoting the price of your Tailor Made Tour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Missed Departures</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that you have all necessary passports, visas and other travel documents and that you are at the correct departure point at the correct time. We cannot accept any responsibility for your failure to do so, nor any costs or expenses incurred as a result of you failing to do so (which will be treated as a cancellation by you). No monies will be refunded for any missed departures or unused services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Refusal of Travel</h3>

<p>Rabbie&rsquo;s reserves the right to refuse to carry any person whose conduct or manner is likely to cause offence or upset to other passengers. Rabbie&rsquo;s also reserves the right to refuse travel to any person who is experiencing medical symptoms likely to cause ill health to others. It is therefore vital that you ensure that you are fit to travel on the departure date.</p>

<p>In either of the cases mentioned above, full cancellation charges shall be applied by Rabbie&rsquo;s and Rabbie&rsquo;s shall have no further liability to that passenger or to any person travelling with them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Our Liability and Actions of Suppliers</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of the aspects of your holiday experience (of which your tour may form part) are provided by independent suppliers, who provide such products and services on the basis of their own terms and conditions. In particular, tickets for travel on other carriers are subject to the normal conditions of carriage of the individual carrier. We may share your personal information with other carriers insofar as necessary to enable products and services to be provided. Further details of this can be found in the privacy policy available <a href="info/about-us/privacy-cookies.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Subject as set out below, Rabbie&rsquo;s will not accept or have any liability for any acts or omissions (whether negligent or otherwise) of any supplier or person providing services in connection with any tour unless such a person is employed by or under the direct control of Rabbie&rsquo;s.Although we will use reasonable skill and care in verifying descriptions and other information provided by third party suppliers, we cannot guarantee that all such information is accurate, complete or correct and each such supplier remains responsible for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the information provided to us by them.</p>

<p>This does not, however, affect your statutory rights under the 2018 Regulations, to the extent applicable to your booking. If you consider that any aspect of your tour does not conform with your booking then you should notify us of this without undue delay, in accordance with Regulation 15(3) of the 2018 Regulations.To the extent that these Regulations do apply to your tour booking, then we will endeavour so far as possible to remedy any lack of conformity within a reasonable period.You may be entitled to a price reduction and/or compensation as a result of any such lack of conformity.</p>

<p><strong>If we are found liable to pay you compensation, then (subject to the following paragraphs) the maximum amount which we will be liable to pay to you in respect of any claim shall be limited to three times the price paid to Rabbie&rsquo;s for your booking, in total. This limitation shall not apply to any claims relating to death or personal injury or fraud or negligence (or any other type of claim that cannot be excluded or limited at law). You must notify us of any potential claims under this provision at the earliest opportunity.</strong></p>

<p>Rabbie&rsquo;s shall not be liable for unforeseeable or indirect losses.We will not be responsible for, nor will we be liable to pay compensation for, any loss, cost, damage or claim to the extent that it results from:-</p>

<p>i. any act and/or omission by you;</p>

<p>ii. ii. the act or omission of any third party unconnected with the provision of the services contracted for and which were unforeseeable or unavoidable;</p>

<p>iii. iii. unusual or unforeseeable circumstances beyond our (or our suppliers&rsquo;) control, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had been taken; or</p>

<p>iv. iv. any event which either we or our suppliers could not, even with all due care, have foreseen or forestalled.</p>

<p>Rabbie&rsquo;s cannot assume responsibility for any costs incurred for any travel arrangements purchased separately from Rabbie&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rabbie&rsquo;s Tours that include Rail travel</strong></p>

<p>In the case of delayed or cancelled train services:</p>

<p>If your train is delayed by more than 15 minutes, or is cancelled, please contact Rabbie&rsquo;s and we will provide assistance in arranging public transport alternatives. Depending on the specific circumstances and availability of transport options, your itinerary may be rearranged to bring you to an alternative meeting point. In this case, or if alternative transport cannot be arranged, we will provide compensation for any missed portion of your tour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Missed Departures:</strong></p>

<p>We are not liable for compensation due to missed train departures. You can contact Rabbie&rsquo;s for assistance in this case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ticket Collection:</strong></p>

<p>Please note, once your train ticket has been collected, it is non-amendable and non-refundable unless the service is cancelled or delayed.</p>

<p>We recommend arriving 45 minutes prior to your departure to allow enough time to collect your ticket and locate your platform.</p>

<p>Please refer to our supplier Terms and Conditions and for further train service details see:</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Special Requests</h3>

<p><br />
Any special requests should be advised to us at the time of booking. Whilst we will try to accommodate your reasonable special requests, we cannot (unless we have specifically agreed any special requirements with you as part of your booking) guarantee that they will be fulfilled and failure to meet any special request will not be a breach of contract on our part. Where appropriate, we will pass any special requests on to your accommodation provider(s), but we cannot be held responsible for their failure or inability to meet your request. Please also be aware that some accommodation providers may make an additional charge (payable locally) depending on the nature of your request. We regret that we cannot accept bookings which are conditional on any special request being met.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Disabilities and Medical Problems</h3>

<p><br />
We will try to accommodate disabilities and medical problems where we can but please be aware that many of our tours may not be suitable. If you or any member of your party has any disability or medical problem which may affect their ability to travel on our tour then please provide us with full details at the time of making your booking enquiry, so that we can advise you as to the suitability of your chosen arrangements. If we are not informed of any disabilities or medical problems in this way then we cannot be held responsible for any cost or inconvenience incurred if we are unable to accommodate you or any member of your party.</p>

<p>If, acting reasonably, we are unable to accommodate the needs of the person(s) concerned then we will not confirm your booking or (if you did not give us details of the disability or medical problem at the time of making the booking request) we shall be entitled to cancel your booking and to levy the relevant cancellation charges.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p><br />
We regret that we do not carry children under the age of 5 on our scheduled tours (which includes, one-day, half-day, city tours and extended tours). Passengers aged 5-15 years old need to be accompanied by an adult. Child prices will vary depending on, for example, the policies of relevant accommodation providers or other suppliers. Please enquire about this at the time of making your booking enquiry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Luggage</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we operate our tours in mini-coaches our luggage space is limited and we operate under strict legal weight regulations for safety reasons.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise notified, passengers are restricted to one medium sized suitcase/bag similar to airline standard carry-on luggage, with a maximum weight of 14kg (31lbs).</p>

<p>As a guideline, the dimensions should be approximately 55cm x 45 x 25 (22ins x 17 x 10). You can also bring a small, lightweight bag for personal items to carry with you on the vehicle.</p>

<p>On our Europe tours, you&#39;re allowed up to 20kg (44lbs). This may consist of a small bag for onboard personal items and a larger suitcase or rucksack.</p>

<p>As this is a legal requirement, we reserve the right to refuse to carry luggage over this weight/size and may refuse travel for passengers who do not have arrangements in place to store excess baggage.</p>

<p>Please see our <a href="info/about-us/faqs.html">FAQs</a> for information on luggage and storage facilities.</p>

<p>Luggage is carried free of charge but at the passenger&#39;s own risk. It is the passenger&#39;s responsibility to ensure that luggage is fit for travel, i.e sturdy and waterproof. Travellers have to be able to lift their own luggage. You may have to carry your bag to and from your accommodation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Smoking</h3>

<p><br />
Smoking (including e-cigarettes) is not permitted on coaches but there are frequent stops en route for those passengers who wish to smoke.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p><br />
We actively welcome your feedback, both in respect of our own services and those provided by other suppliers (such as accommodation providers). In the event that you have any complaint during the course of your tour (or if you consider that any service provided during your tour does not conform with your contract with Rabbie&rsquo;s) then please bring this to the attention of your driver or tour guide as soon as possible, and we will endeavour to resolve the matter to your satisfaction. For more information about accommodation <u> <a href="info/about-us/faqs.html#acc"> click here </a> </u> , which can also be accessed at:</p>

<p><a href="info/about-us/faqs.html#acc">https://www.rabbies.com/en/info/about-us/faqs#acc </a></p>

<p>If your complaint is not resolved locally and you wish to complain further then please contact us at <a href="mailto:feedback@rabbies.com">feedback@rabbies.com</a> providing all relevant information necessary to enable us to consider your complaint. We would request that any complaints be raised with us within 28 days of the end of your tour, as otherwise our ability to investigate the complaint properly may be affected.</p>

<p>You can also access the European Commission Online Dispute (ODR) Resolution platform at <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/"> http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/ </a> . This ODR platform is a means of registering your complaint; it will not determine how your complaint should be resolved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Insurance</h3>

<p><br />
Rabbie&rsquo;s strongly recommends that passengers arrange suitable travel, medical and cancellation insurance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
